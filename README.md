# Crop-Recommendation-and-Disease-Prediction
Agriculture is vital to sustain life and contributes $1.4 trillion to the US economy. This project is aimed at developing a model that can provide farmers with accurate recommendations on which crops to grow based on the specific conditions of their land. This project can be of immense value to farmers who want to improve their crop yields and optimize their use of resources. The model will be developed using various machine learning algorithms that can analyze different data sources, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and weather patterns in the region. The model will provide recommendations based on the analysis of these data sources, taking into account factors such as the availability of water resources and the use of fertilizers. Additionally, the project can contribute to sustainable farming practices by promoting the efficient use of resources and reducing the negative impact on the environment.
